## 🏗️ Revolutionary Storytelling Techniques

### 1. Non-Linear Temporal Structure
**Philosophy**: Time as fluid, interconnected experience rather than linear progression

**Implementation**:

## 📖 Key Quotes & Philosophy

> "The allotted function of art is not, as is often assumed, to put across ideas, to propagate thoughts, to serve as example. The aim of art is to prepare a person for death, to plough and harrow his soul, rendering it capable of turning to good."

> "We can express our feelings regarding the world around us either by poetic or by descriptive means. I prefer to express myself metaphorically. Let me stress: metaphorically, not symbolically. A symbol contains within itself a definite meaning, certain intellectual formula, while metaphor is an image. An image possessing the same distinguishing features as the world it represents."

> "The image becomes truly emotional through the dynamic of time running through it... The time that runs through the image, time as fact... becomes the foundation of the image."
