> "I want to portray a slightly different world, but I also want to make a world that could be true - like the world I would have liked to see when I was a child."

> "The concept of portraying evil and then destroying it - I know this is considered mainstream, but I think it is rotten. This idea that whenever something evil happens someone particular can be blamed and punished for it, in life and in politics, is hopeless."

> "I believe that fantasy in the meaning of imagination is very important. What somebody imagines can be shared by others, and then it can become a reality."

> "Modern life is so thin and shallow and fake. I look forward to when developers go bankrupt, Japan gets poorer and wild grasses take over."
