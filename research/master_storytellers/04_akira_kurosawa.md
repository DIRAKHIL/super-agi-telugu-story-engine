### 3. Movement Composition
**Philosophy**: "Composing Movement" - choreographing action within frame
**Techniques**:
- **Directional Movement**: Characters moving in specific patterns to create visual rhythm
- **Layered Action**: Multiple planes of movement creating depth
- **Geometric Patterns**: Movement following mathematical principles
- **Emotional Expression**: Physical movement reflecting internal psychological states

### 4. Weather as Character
**Environmental Storytelling**: Using natural elements as narrative devices
**Applications**:

- **Moral Ambiguity**: No single "correct" version of events

**Structural Elements**:
1. **Frame Story**: Present-day characters discussing past events
2. **Multiple Accounts**: Each witness/participant tells different version
3. **Contradictory Details**: Facts change based on narrator's perspective
4. **Psychological Motivation**: Each version serves narrator's emotional needs
5. **Unresolved Truth**: Audience left to determine reality

### Character Perspective Techniques
