## üèóÔ∏è Revolutionary Storytelling Techniques

### 1. Non-Linear Temporal Architecture
**Time Manipulation Philosophy**: Time as sculptural material for narrative construction

**Techniques**:
- **Reverse Chronology**: Stories told backward (Memento)
- **Parallel Timelines**: Multiple timeframes intersecting (The Prestige, Dunkirk)
- **Nested Narratives**: Stories within stories (Inception)
- **Time Dilation**: Different temporal speeds within same narrative (Inception, Interstellar)

**Structural Patterns**:
- **Following**: Four timelines, three intercut
- **Memento**: Two timelines (one forward, one backward)
- **The Prestige**: Four timelines, three intercut
- **Inception**: Four timelines framed by fifth
- **Dunkirk**: Three timelines creating Shepard tone effect

### 2. Metaleptic Storytelling Devices
