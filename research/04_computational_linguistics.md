# Computational Linguistics Research Module

## Abstract

This research module investigates computational approaches to understanding and generating emotionally resonant narratives. We examine natural language processing techniques for emotional analysis, story structure detection, character development modeling, and culturally-aware text generation. Our findings inform the development of sophisticated language models capable of creating compelling stories with appropriate emotional arcs and cultural sensitivity.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Research Questions

1. How can computational models effectively analyze and generate emotional content in narratives?
2. What linguistic features best predict story engagement and emotional impact?
3. How can language models be adapted for culturally specific storytelling traditions?
4. What are the optimal architectures for multi-modal narrative understanding and generation?

### 1.2 Theoretical Framework

Our research builds upon several computational linguistics paradigms:

- **Distributional Semantics** (Harris, 1954): Meaning from linguistic context
- **Computational Narrative Theory** (Mani, 2012): Formal models of story structure
- **Affective Computing** (Picard, 1997): Emotion recognition and generation in text
- **Cultural Language Models** (Hovy & Yang, 2021): Culturally-aware NLP systems

## 2. Literature Review

### 2.1 Emotion Detection and Analysis in Text

#### Lexicon-Based Approaches
Early emotion detection relied on predefined word lists:

        super().__init__()
        self.bert = bert_model
        self.emotion_lexicon = emotion_lexicon
        self.emotion_classifier = nn.Linear(768 + len(emotion_lexicon), 8)
    
    def forward(self, input_ids, attention_mask):
        # BERT contextual embeddings
        bert_output = self.bert(input_ids, attention_mask)
        
        # Lexicon features
        lexicon_features = self.extract_lexicon_features(input_ids)
        
        # Combine features
        combined_features = torch.cat([bert_output.pooler_output, lexicon_features], dim=1)
        
        # Emotion classification
        emotion_logits = self.emotion_classifier(combined_features)
        return emotion_logits
```

**Hierarchical Emotion Model**:
```python
class HierarchicalEmotionAnalyzer(nn.Module):

        super().__init__()
        self.word_encoder = nn.LSTM(300, 128, bidirectional=True)
        self.sentence_encoder = nn.LSTM(256, 128, bidirectional=True)
        self.document_encoder = nn.LSTM(256, 128, bidirectional=True)
        self.emotion_classifier = nn.Linear(256, 8)
    
    def forward(self, document):
        # Word-level encoding
        word_representations = []
        for sentence in document:
            word_output, _ = self.word_encoder(sentence)
            sentence_rep = word_output[-1]  # Last hidden state
            word_representations.append(sentence_rep)
        
        # Sentence-level encoding
        sentence_sequence = torch.stack(word_representations)
        sentence_output, _ = self.sentence_encoder(sentence_sequence)
        
        # Document-level encoding
        document_output, _ = self.document_encoder(sentence_output)
        
        # Emotion prediction
        emotion_logits = self.emotion_classifier(document_output[-1])
        return emotion_logits
```

    def __init__(self, vocab_size, embedding_dim, hidden_dim):
        super().__init__()
        self.embedding = nn.Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim)
        self.lstm = nn.LSTM(embedding_dim, hidden_dim, batch_first=True)
        self.attention = nn.MultiheadAttention(hidden_dim, num_heads=8)
        self.classifier = nn.Linear(hidden_dim, 7)  # 7 plot points
    
    def forward(self, input_ids):
        # Embedding and LSTM encoding
        embedded = self.embedding(input_ids)
        lstm_output, _ = self.lstm(embedded)
        
        # Self-attention for long-range dependencies
        attended_output, _ = self.attention(lstm_output, lstm_output, lstm_output)

        self.context_encoder = nn.LSTM(context_dim, arc_dim)
        self.arc_predictor = nn.Linear(arc_dim * 2, arc_dim)
        self.development_classifier = nn.Linear(arc_dim, 5)  # Development stages
    
    def forward(self, character_features, context_sequence):
        # Encode character features
        character_rep = self.character_encoder(character_features)
        
        # Encode narrative context
        context_output, _ = self.context_encoder(context_sequence)
        context_rep = context_output[-1]
        
        # Combine character and context
        combined_rep = torch.cat([character_rep, context_rep], dim=1)

        self.cultural_dimensions = cultural_dimensions
    
    def forward(self, input_ids, attention_mask, cultural_context):
        # Standard BERT encoding
        bert_output = self.bert(input_ids, attention_mask)
        
        # Cultural adaptation
        cultural_weights = self.compute_cultural_weights(cultural_context)
        adapted_output = self.cultural_adapter(bert_output.last_hidden_state)
        adapted_output = adapted_output * cultural_weights.unsqueeze(1)
        
        return adapted_output
    
    def compute_cultural_weights(self, cultural_context):
        # Map cultural dimensions to attention weights
        weights = torch.zeros(len(cultural_context), 768)
        for i, context in enumerate(cultural_context):
            for dim, value in context.items():
                if dim in self.cultural_dimensions:
                    dim_weights = self.cultural_dimensions[dim]
